                    Web accessibility allows individuals the same online experience regardless of their method of acquiring information. 
                    Websites that are not coded following the accessibility guidelines can have a negative interaction with screen readers, making content
                    difficult or impossible to access. Individuals should not be denied access to information just because they use this
                    assistive technology.
