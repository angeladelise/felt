                        Screen readers use synthesized speech to narrate a site and can present the information in a braille display. The most popular screen readers are JAWS, VoiceOver and NVDA.

                <p> 
                    Individuals in the blind community rely on screen readers to gain access to the internet and digital content. Individuals with various other impairments may also use screen readers if they are not able to use a mouse.

                <p> 
                    Web accessibility allows individuals the same online experience regardless of their method of acquiring information. 
                    Websites that are not coded following the accessibility guidelines can have a negative interaction with screen readers, making content
                    difficult or impossible to access. Individuals should not be denied access to information just because they use this
                    assistive technology.
