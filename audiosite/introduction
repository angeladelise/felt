            <h2 class="homepageheader">Web Accessibility</h2>
            <p> 
                Web accessibility allows individuals the same online experience regardless of their method of acquiring information. 
                Websites that are not coded following the accessibility guidelines can have a negative interaction with screen readers, making content
                difficult or impossible to access. Individuals should not be denied access to information just because they use this
                assistive technology.
