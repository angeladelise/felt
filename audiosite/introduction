        <h2>What is a screen reader?</h2>
        <p> Screen readers are a type of assistive technology which 
            transforms digital content into auditory content, allowing users to navigate websites by sound. 
            The most popular screen readers are JAWS, VoiceOver and NVDA.
        </p>


        <h2>Who uses screen readers?</h2>
        <p> 
            This technology is often used by
            individuals in the blind community and individuals with physical impairments. 
        </p>

        <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>
        <p> 
            Web accessibility allows individuals the same online experience regardless of their method of acquiring information. 
            Websites that are not coded following the accessibility guidelines can have a negative interaction with screen readers, making content
            difficult or impossible to access. Individuals should not be denied access to information just because they use this
            assistive technology.
